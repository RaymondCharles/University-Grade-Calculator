# University-Grade-Calculator
Java Program 

A program that asks the user how many of a particular grade (A, B, C etc.) a student achieved
and works the grade they are consistently achieving and the overall grade they gained.

To Run the program the user should enter the number of times they earned each grade. The grading system works like this:

- To get an A* they need all 8 grades to be A+.

- To get an A++ they need at least 7 of the grades to be an A+ or better and all 8 to be an A or better.

- To get an A+ they need at least 6 of the grades to be an A+ or better and all 8 to be an A or better.

- To get an A they need at least 6 of the grades to be an A or better and all 8 to be a B or better.

- To get a B they need at least 6 of the grades to be a B or better and all 8 to be a C or better.

- To get a C they need at least 6 of the grades to be a C or better and all 8 to be a D or better.

- To get a D they need at least 6 of the grades to be a D or better and all 8 to be an F or better.

- To get an F they need at least 6 of the grades to be a D or better and all 8 to be a G or better.

- To get a G they need all 8 grades to be a G or better. Otherwise they get a Q grade.

An example run of the program (numbers in bold are typed by the user):

How many A+ grades did you get? **1**

How many A grades did you get? **4**

How many B grades did you get? **1**

How many C grades did you get? **2**

How many D grades did you get? **0**

How many F grades did you get? **0**

How many G grades did you get? **0**

You consistently gained a B grade or better.

Therefore you gained a B grade overall.
